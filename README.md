# Hotkey-Script
>This is something I use multiple times every day.

Script that allows me to do many things with just hotkeys.

Really common thing to do but because I use these hotkeys so much I thought I would put it here.
- Num1: open gmail
- Num2: open outlook
- Num3: open dropbox
- Num4: change default audio device (effectively allowing for changing between speakers and headphones)
- Home: pause/play music (or whatever window is currently making audio)
- Ins: prev song
- PgUp: next song
